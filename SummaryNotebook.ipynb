    "We have two hypotehses -- one about vistiaton and one about count. \n",

    "If libraries make people happy, then countries with more libraries and higher visitation rates of those libraries will have higher happiness scores.\n",

    "If libraries do not generate happiness then there will library count and library visits will have no impact on happiness scores.\n",
